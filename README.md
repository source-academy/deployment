[Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org) is an online experiential environment for computational thinking. Developed for courses that use the book [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Edition*](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/index) (SICP JS), the environment is currently supporting TypeScript and JavaScript, and educational sublanguages of Java, C, Python, and Scheme.  Here you find resources for [learners and educators who use SICP JS](https://about.sourceacademy.org/learner/README.html), for [developers](https://about.sourceacademy.org/developer/README.html), and for educational [researchers](https://about.sourceacademy.org/research/README.html). <!-- use full URLs for these three references here -->

Our mission is to *expose the beauty and fun in computational thinking, and make them universally accessible*.
