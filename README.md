The Source Academy is immersive online experiential environment for computational thinking. Originally, it was developed for a community of learners who use the book [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Edition*](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/) (SICP JS). Recently, the system is getting extended to support computational thinking using TypeScript, Java, C, Python, and Scheme.  Here you find resources for [learners and educators](https://about.sourceacademy.org/learner/README.html) who use SICP JS, for [developers](https://about.sourceacademy.org/developer/README.html) of the system, and for educational [researchers](https://about.sourceacademy.org/research/README.html). <!-- use full URLs for these three references here -->

To get an idea of the system and community, watch the videos of our

Our mission is to *expose the beauty and fun in computational thinking, and make them universally accessible*.
