# Resources for learners who use SICP JS

The learners in the Source Academy community might find the following resources useful.

- [Interactive SICP JS](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs): online version of the textbook *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Edition* 
- [SICP JS in print](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs-1): print version of *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Edition*, published by MIT Press
- [SICP JS in PDF](https://sicp.sourceacademy.org/sicpjs.pdf): latest PDF, subject to a [CC NC-BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
- [Programs of SICP JS](https://sicp.sourceacademy.org/sicpjs.zip): all programs of the book, in a zip file
- [Source](https://docs.sourceacademy.org): Source languages used in the book (sublanguages of JavaScript)
- [SICP JS on github](https://github.com/source-academy/sicp): repository for typesetting our own copy and contributing

Currently, learners have the following options. If you take a course based on SICP JS, check with your instructor which option applies to the course:

- [Learn with SICP JS without Source Academy](../package/README.md) 
- [Learn with Source Academy](../vanilla/README.md) (public site)
- [Learn with Source Academy @ X](x/README.md) 

# Resources for educators who use SICP JS

The educators in the Source Academy community might find the following resources useful. In addition, the NUS instructor team provides educator material including homework assignments, exams of previous years with solutions, and weekly classroom exercises. Email [sourceacademy@nus.edu.sg](mailto:sourceacademy@comp.nus.edu.sg) to get access to these resources. 

Educators have the following options to work with [SICP JS](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/):
- Not use Source Academy: You can use SICP JS with the IDE of your choice; [see here](../package/README.md) for more information
- Use the public version of the Source Academy; [see here](../vanilla/README.md) how [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org/) supports your course
- Source Academy @ NUS: An extension of Source Academy; [go here](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg) to create your account and start your course
- Deploy your own Source Academy @ X; [see here](../deployment/README.md) how to do that

Educators who have used the original Scheme-based SICP book may appreciate our [Scheme-JavaScript Comparison Edition](https://sicp.sourceacademy.org), where SICP and SICP JS can be viewed side-by-side.

## Resources for educators who use [Source Academy @ NUS](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/)

- Register as instructor: send an email to [source.academy.nus@gmail.com](mailto:source.academy.nus@gmail.com)
- [Guide for authoring and uploading assessments](assessment/README.md): homework submissions stored on the **Source Academy @ NUS** or any other Source Academy server, graded by you and your assistants or auto-graded
