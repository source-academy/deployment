# Resources for developers

## Community

The Source Academy was conceived, designed, and implemented by a community of undergraduate students. See the [contributors page](https://sourceacademy.org/contributors) for the Hall of Fame, current project leadership, and all Github contributors.

## Current Development Activities

Currently (2023-2024) the following intiatives are under way to extend and improve
Source Academy. All of these are being pursued by Computer Science undergraduate
students of the National University of Singapore.

- Numerous improvements in the frontend and backend, including game support, grading, folders, visualization, share links, sessions, stories, contests, and mobile support
- Support for new languages: TypeScript, Scheme, Python, C, Java, C\#

## Deployment

- The serverless frontend (github repo `frontend`) is currently auto-deployed to [sourceacademy.org](https://sourceacademy.org).
- The JavaScript language implementations (github repo `js-slang`) are (manually) published to [NPM js-slang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-slang); the implementations of Python (github repo `py-slang`) and Scheme (github repo `scm-slang) are sub-modules of `js-slang`).
- The WebAssembly-based language implementation (github repo `sourceror`) is (manually) published to [NPM sourceror](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sourceror).
- The sharing service for collaborative editing (github repo `sharedb-ace`) is (manually) published to [NPM @sourceacademy/sharedb-ace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sourceacademy/sharedb-ace).
- The runtime component for Source on embedded systems (github repo `sling`) is (manually) published to [NPM @sourceacademy/sling-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sourceacademy/sling-client).
- The JavaScript module that goes with [SICP JS](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/index) (github repo `sicp`) is auto-deployed to [NPM sicp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sicp)
- The [SICP JS](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/index) textbook chapters, sections, and subsections (github repo `sicp`) are auto-deployed to `sicp.sourceacademy.org/json`, e.g. [sicp.sourceacademy.org/json/1.json](https://sicp.sourceacademy.org/json/1.json).
- SourceAcademy @ NUS (including the backend, github repo `backend`) is (manually) deployed to an AWS server at (sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg)[https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg].
